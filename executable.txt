Compile all opencv files with: 
g++ file.cpp -o file /usr/lib64/libopencv_core.so.2.4 /usr/lib64/libopencv_highgui.so.2.4 /usr/lib64/libopencv_imgproc.so.2.4 /usr/lib64/libopencv_objdetect.so.2.4

Compile the "bounding.hs" file with
ghc -O2 -o bounding bounding.hs

Different opencv programs take different arguments upon executing.
The bounding.hs program takes one argument: the location of the "bounding.txt" file that it is meant to read.
