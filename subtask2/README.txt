We used the haskell script (which has the co-ordinates for the ground bounding boxes hard coded into it) in order to
generate f-scores for each of the images when given another set of co-ordinates in the form of a string that was generated by the dart_print
program. This had to be done image by image at this stage of the assignment but was subsequently improved so that it didn't have to, later on.
